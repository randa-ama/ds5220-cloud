# DS5220 Advanced Cloud Computing

An intensive overview of cloud infrastructure and their role in data science. Topics will include storage as a service, ephemeral computing resources, auto-scaling, and event-driven workloads. Special attention will be paid to cloud-native design patterns, which are built assuming the unique functionality of cloud computing resources.
